# jesting-and-testing

toying around with jest as a homework autograder - might become useful for teach la soon :)

to use & clone:

```sh
$ yarn
$ yarn test
```

currently, just prototyping out a simple math homework assignment for teaching web dev. things I'd like to explore:

* function spying (e.g. [recursive calls](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45102677/testing-recursive-calls-in-jest)) 
* memory leaks
* scoping
* DOM testing
* hooking with Enzyme effectively
* optional / extra tests

other math test-y things (needs to be implementable w/out `Math` library)

* quadratic equation
* fibonacci (could check memoization)
* slope of line generator
